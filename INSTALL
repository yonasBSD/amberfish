COMPILING (SIMPLE)

Typing 'make' in this directory will attempt to build Amberfish.  By
default this will NOT include XML support.  Please see below for
installing XML support.

Typeing 'make install' will attempt to install the Amberfish binaries
in /usr/local/bin/.


COMPILING WITH XML SUPPORT

Enabling XML support in Amberfish requires downloading, patching, and
compiling the 'Xerces C++' parser.  Patching is required because
recent versions of Xerces changed a method needed by Amberfish from
'public' to 'protected'.  Here are instructions for getting Xerces
working with Amberfish:

* If you already have a version of Xerces installed, it is recommended
that you uninstall it (if possible) before continuing.  This will
simplify matters and avoid confusion.

* Download a recent Xerces source release from:

  http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/

* Unpack the Xerces package and 'cd' into the package's top level
directory.

* Apply the patch (src/xerces.patch) to Xerces.  This should be done
from within the Xerces top level directory (or, if you downloaded a
'nightly build', in c/ under the top level directory).  For example,
if you unpacked the current version of Xerces into the src/ directory
of Amberfish, type:

    patch -p0 < ../xerces.patch

NOTE: The patch was tested with a recent version of Xerces at the time
this release was put together.  We hope it also works with later
versions of Xerces.  If not, the point of the patch is to make
XMLScanner::getScanner() public instead of protected.  You can make
that simple change by hand in src/xercesc/parsers/SAXParser.hpp .

* Build Xerces, following its build instructions.  On Linux running
bash, you may find this to work:

  cd src/xercesc
  autoconf
  export XERCESCROOT=`pwd`/../..
  runConfigure -plinux
  gmake

* Install Xerces.  You can either do a system-wide installation or
copy the needed files where Amberfish can find them.  Amberfish needs
the src/xercesc directory placed in an include path and the Xerces
libraries (lib/libxerces-c.so*) placed in the library path.

* Compile Amberfish (by typing 'make').

* Be sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH points to the Xerces library before running
Amberfish binaries.
