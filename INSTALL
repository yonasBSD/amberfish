INSTALLATION OF XML PARSER

To use the XML features of Amberfish, you need the Xerces C++ parser.
Xerces is available here:

  http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/

If you are using Linux, you may already have Xerces installed.  Look
for a library file like 'libxerces-c.so'.

The build process for Amberfish will look for Xerces, and if Xerces
cannot be found, then XML support will be disabled in Amberfish.  Once
you have Xerces installed, follow the instructions below for Amberfish
installation.


AMBERFISH INSTALLATION

Typing 'make' in this directory will attempt to build Amberfish.
Compiled executables will be placed in the bin/ directory.

If the Xerces library is in a non-standard location, be sure that
LD_LIBRARY_PATH points to that location before using Amberfish.

Typing 'make install' in this directory will attempt to install the
Amberfish executables in /usr/local/bin/.

Type 'make' in the doc/ directory to build documentation files.
