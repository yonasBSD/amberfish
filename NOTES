RELEASE NOTES


RECENT CHANGES

* The linearization code is undergoing major changes.  If you
encounter bugs such as crashes or wrong results, try indexing with the
'--old-linear' option which will cause af to revert to the old
linearization code used in stable versions 1.2.x.


OTHER NOTES, BUGS, AND OUTSTANDING ISSUES

* There is a new, experimental "af" tool that combines most of the
functions of afindex, afsearch, and afadmin.  The old tools are
planned to be phased out over time.  Note that there are now two
versions of the tutorial (PDF), one for the old tools and one for the
new.  There is also a new man page for af which is updated frequently.

* Experimental "afd" server.  This is part of a proof-of-concept for
the girtools project and is not currently usable for anything.  It is
not compiled by default.

* Unoptimized databases.  Amberfish can only search databases that
have been linearized with -O.  (The new af tool linearizes by
default.)

* Memory leaks.  There seems to be a memory leak in the search code.
We could use assistance in tracking this down.

* Indexing with '-t xml' apparently does not return an error message
(as it should) when XML support is disabled.  Not sure what it
actually does!

* Stop words.  All words are currently indexed and searched.

* Multiple documents.  The -split option (--split in the new af tool)
specifies a delimiter string to show the boundaries of multiple
documents within a file.  This should probably be enhanced a little
bit to allow characters such as '\n'.

* Using '*' alone as a search term.  This is undefined and may cause
strange behavior.

* Stability of C/C++ API.  The C/C++ interface will be undergoing
major changes.

* Phrase searching without being enabled.  Searching for a phrase in a
database that was created without -phrase (or --phrase in the new af
tool) returns no results rather than an error message.  This needs to
be fixed.
