RELEASE NOTES (SINCE AMBERFISH 1.1.8)

* The configure script now takes the --disable-xml option, which tells
it not to try to link with Xerces.


OTHER NOTES, BUGS, AND OUTSTANDING ISSUES

* Indexing non-regular files.  There is a known bug that causes many
error message to be printed if afindex is used with non-regular files
such as directories.  For now it is best to ensure that only regular
files are passed to afindex.

* Documentation errors.  Building the documentation generates lots of
errors.  They are related to navigation and are harmless for the most
part.

* Unoptimized databases.  Amberfish can only search databases that
have been optimized with -O.

* Optimization speed.  The optimize (-O) code is slow and needs to be
rewritten.

* Memory leaks.  There are known memory leaks associated with
searching.  We could use assistance in tracking these down.

* Indexing with '-t xml' apparently does not return an error message
(as it should) when XML support is disabled.  Not sure what it
actually does!

* Stop words.  All words are currently indexed and searched.

* Multiple documents.  The -split option specifies a delimiter string
to show the boundaries of multiple documents within a file.  This
should probably be enhanced a little bit to allow characters such as
'\n'.

* Using '*' alone as a search term.  This is undefined and may cause
strange behavior.

* Stability of C/C++ API.  The C/C++ interface is unstable for
indexing and document classes.  The interface for searching is
moderately stable, and the others need to be rewritten to conform to
it.

* Phrase searching without -phrase.  Searching for a phrase in a
database that was created without -phrase returns no results rather
than an error message.  (This needs to be fixed.)
