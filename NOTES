RELEASE NOTES


RECENT CHANGES

* Experimental "af" tool.  There is a new af tool that combines most
of the functions of afindex, afsearch, and afadmin.  There is
preliminary documentation in a man page under doc/.  If it works well,
the old tools will be phased out.  At this stage, it is still work in
progress.

* Fixed bug causing multiple error messages when afindex is given bad
input files.

* The configure script now takes the --disable-xml option, which tells
it not to try to link with Xerces.


OTHER NOTES, BUGS, AND OUTSTANDING ISSUES

* Experimental "amberfishd" server.  This is part of a
proof-of-concept for the girtools project and is not currently usable
for anything.  It is not compiled by default.

* Unoptimized databases.  Amberfish can only search databases that
have been linearized with -O.  (The new af tool linearizes by
default.)

* Optimization speed.  The linearizing code is slow and needs to be
rewritten.

* Memory leaks.  There seems to be a memory leak in the search code.
We could use assistance in tracking this down.

* Indexing with '-t xml' apparently does not return an error message
(as it should) when XML support is disabled.  Not sure what it
actually does!

* Stop words.  All words are currently indexed and searched.

* Multiple documents.  The -split option (--split in the new af tool)
specifies a delimiter string to show the boundaries of multiple
documents within a file.  This should probably be enhanced a little
bit to allow characters such as '\n'.

* Using '*' alone as a search term.  This is undefined and may cause
strange behavior.

* Stability of C/C++ API.  The C/C++ interface will be undergoing
major changes.

* Phrase searching without being enabled.  Searching for a phrase in a
database that was created without -phrase (or --phrase in the new af
tool) returns no results rather than an error message.  This needs to
be fixed.

additional outstanding problems.
