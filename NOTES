RELEASE NOTES


RECENT CHANGES

1.5.3

* Experimental search options, -n (--numhits), --skiphits, and
--totalhits.

1.5.2

* Fixed bug in 1.5.1 that caused incremental indexing (i.e. adding to
an existing database) not to work with -F.

1.5.1

* Development versions 1.5.x contain experimental code that allow
searching of unlinearized databases.  Linearizing is no longer
performed by default but must be specified explicitly with the '-L'
command option.

1.4.x / 1.3.x

* The linearizing (optimizing) code has been completely rewritten and
is now somewhat faster.  The '--old-linear' option disables the new
function and instead uses the old linearization function from stable
versions 1.2.x.

* Words longer than the maximum word length, currently 32 characters,
are no longer indexed.  To include the words (truncated), use the
'--long-words' option.

* There is a new man page for af which includes additional options not
mentioned in the tutorial.


OTHER NOTES, BUGS, AND OUTSTANDING ISSUES

* There is a new "af" tool that combines most of the functions of
afindex, afsearch, and afadmin.  Using the old tools is deprecated.
They are no longer compiled by default, with the exception of affetch.
To compile them, you can use:

  cd src; make afindex afsearch afadmin

* Memory leaks.  There seems to be a memory leak in the search code.
We could use assistance in tracking this down.

* Indexing with '-t xml' apparently does not return an error message
(as it should) when XML support is disabled.  Not sure what it
actually does!

* Stop words.  All words are currently indexed and searched.

* Multiple documents.  The --split option specifies a delimiter string
to show the boundaries of multiple documents within a file.  This
should probably be enhanced a little bit to allow characters such as
'\n'.

* Using '*' alone as a search term.  This is undefined and may cause
strange behavior.

* Stability of C/C++ API.  The C/C++ interface will be undergoing
major changes.

* Phrase searching without being enabled.  Searching for a phrase in a
database that was created without --phrase returns no results rather
than an error message.  This needs to be fixed.
