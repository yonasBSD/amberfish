RELEASE NOTES


RECENT CHANGES

* There is a new experimental --no-normalize-scores search option (not
yet documented).  With this option, af returns unnormalized scores
rather than scaling them from 0 to 100.  To get the raw calculated
score, divide the unnormalized score by 10000.

* The new command option --delete marks documents as deleted.  The
format of search results has been modified to report deletion status.
A --prune option is planned to remove deleted documents from search
results.  (Documentation not yet updated.)

* The HTML and PDF tutorial files are no longer generated by default.

* There is a new experimental C/C++ API, documented in man pages under
doc/.

* The old tools, afindex, afsearch, afadmin, and affetch, have been
removed.

1.5.9

* Various changes related to RPM packaging.

* Fixed the HTML version of the tutorial.

* The new '--fetch' option in af replaces the equivalent function in
affetch; and affetch is no longer compiled by default.

* Disabled the '--long-words' option.  There were bugs associated with
this that will have to be addressed in a future release.  As of 1.5.4,
long words are again indexed by default and cannot be suppressed.

* Experimental search options, -n (--numhits), --skiphits, and
--totalhits.

* Fixed bug in 1.5.1 that caused incremental indexing (i.e. adding to
an existing database) not to work with -F.

* Development versions 1.5.x contain experimental code that allow
searching of unlinearized databases.  Linearizing is no longer
performed by default but must be specified explicitly with the '-L'
command option.


OTHER NOTES, BUGS, AND OUTSTANDING ISSUES

* Stop words.  All words are currently indexed and searched.

* Multiple documents.  The --split option specifies a delimiter string
to show the boundaries of multiple documents within a file.  This
should probably be enhanced a little bit to allow characters such as
'\n'.

* Using '*' alone as a search term.  This is undefined and may cause
strange behavior.

* Phrase searching without being enabled.  Searching for a phrase in a
database that was created without --phrase returns no results rather
than an error message.  This needs to be fixed.

additional outstanding problems.
