PLEASE NOTE: Xerces is no longer bundled with this package.  As a
result, all of the documentation related to XML does not apply unless
you link in an external version of Xerces.  (Linking has become
complicated by the fact that Xerces no longer offers getScanner() or
an equivalent as a public method.)  The rough edges should be smoothed
out over the coming year, during which time the code will remain
tagged as a development/unstable version.  By default, this package
currently has XML support disabled.  Also, some of the documentation
has not yet been updated since the move to SourceForge.

On Linux you may be able to compile this package simply by typing
`make'.

Please refer to the web site for updates:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/amberfish/

See `doc/amberfish.pdf' for the user documentation.  (You may have to
type `make' first in the `doc/' subdirectory.)

We hope you enjoy using Amberfish!
